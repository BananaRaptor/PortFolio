                        Hi, I'm Arnaud, a recent graduate in a web and mobile
                        Development technique and I just started my bachelor
                        Degree in Automated Manufactoring Engineering. My
                        background is mostly in fullstack Development in a
                        variety of languages and framework but I'm always eager
                        to learn more. I opted for this major because I'm
                        passionate about implementing the power of well designed
                        and optimized software in an industrial context and
                        sensing the effects my software has on production and
                        the life of the operator.
